#Title: Home Inventory Script
#Dev: GKim
#Date: Jan 29, 2019
#ChangeLog: GKim, 1-22-19, Created Script
# GKim, 1-23-19, created HomeInventoryWL to include while loop 
# GKim, 1-29-19, reformatted HomeInventory WL to incorporate tuple and give the user
# an option to save the information inputed or not.  Created a new variable to hold
# the 2-dimensional tuple and moved the creation of the text file code to a different
# section and set new conditions to ask the user if they would like to save or not.
#-------------------------------------------#
