# Title: Working with Dictionaries
# Dev:   GKim
# Date:  February 6, 2019
# ChangeLog: (Who, When, What)
# RRoot, 11/02/2016, Created starting template
# GKim, 2-06-19, started text file read back to python dictionary
# GKim, 2-07-19, completed working script for Assignment 5
# GKim, 2-08-19, I added other options to give to the user in the form of yes or no
# and to account for choices other than yes or no or 0-4.
# GKim, 2-9-19, edited code for comments and to account for user error, added a conditional
# if the user misspells has numbers, spacing issues when they are trying to remove a task
# GKim, 2-10-19, found a potential user error in choice "2".  When adding a task i gave the user
# an option to make another choice of going to back to menu, but didn't account for "no" and if the user 
# wanted to save data from option and leave.  Found section of global variable, because a "break" does not 
# work in a function that is in a loop.  
# GKim, 2-10-19, choice "3" was not working properly and had to change range(len(lstTable))to range(len(lstTable)-1, -1, -1)
# This made sure I iterated through my list properly
